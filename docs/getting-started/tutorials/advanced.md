# Product Validation { #advanced-tutorials }

These tutorials assume [Connected Subsystems](intermediate.md) is comfortable territory. You can bring up a peripheral, connect it to middleware, and you have already seen at least one coexistence problem firsthand. This track focuses on the work that separates a working demo from a product you can ship: measured power, safe OTA, custom hardware bring-up, crash analysis, multi-connection Bluetooth, and reusable drivers.

Product-validation work is less about copying a single example and more about building evidence. For each tutorial, keep notes: board revision, SDK version, example base, test setup, expected result, observed result, and what changed.

Use this series when your responsibility extends beyond a feature working once: you need measurable power behavior, recoverable updates, repeatable custom-hardware bring-up, and evidence for failures that happen outside the happy path.

## Tune Low-Power Modes and Wake Sources

**Goal:** get real battery-life evidence instead of assuming firmware is low power because it calls a sleep function.

**Time:** 2+ hours, plus measurement setup

**Start from:** `example/pm/classical`, `example/pm/raise_wrist`

1. Set up current measurement as described in the [Low-Power Overview](../../learn/low-power/overview.md#measuring-power-in-practice).
2. Record a baseline for boot, active, connected idle, display-off idle, and deep sleep if available.
3. Start from the classical PM example and identify where a driver votes for a power state and releases it.
4. Move to the raise-to-wake example and study how an interrupt-driven accelerometer event gates display and application-processor wakeup.
5. Apply the same pattern to your own product: replace unnecessary timers and polling loops with interrupts or event-driven work.
6. Re-measure after each change.
7. If deep sleep is not as deep as expected, use `list_thread`, `list_device`, PM logs, and wake-source instrumentation to find the subsystem still active.

**Success criteria:** the firmware reaches the expected low-power state, current is repeatable across runs, and wake sources are intentional rather than accidental.

**Troubleshooting:** if power looks good once and bad later, check error paths, reconnect paths, display teardown, audio session teardown, and any timer created after startup.

**What you learned:** how to move from "should be low power" to measured low power, and how to track down a PM vote that is quietly being left open.

## Add OTA Firmware Updates over BLE

**Goal:** update firmware in the field without a wired connection.

**Time:** 2 hours

**Start from:** `example/ble/peripheral_with_ota`

1. Build and flash the OTA-enabled peripheral example.
2. Confirm normal BLE peripheral behavior still works before attempting an update.
3. Trigger an OTA update and confirm the device boots the new image.
4. Interrupt an OTA transfer by disconnecting mid-update, losing power if safe for the board, or moving out of range.
5. Confirm the device falls back to the previous valid image instead of bricking.
6. Test OTA after stale bond, phone-side forget-device, and device reboot.
7. If your product already uses PAN for data, evaluate the PAN OTA path as a separate design choice.

**Success criteria:** successful OTA updates boot the new image, failed OTA attempts recover cleanly, and the user-facing state is understandable after either result.

**Troubleshooting:** check partition layout, image signing or integrity checks if used, rollback markers, connection parameters during transfer, and whether bond or storage changes survive update.

**What you learned:** partition and rollback design, and why "OTA works once" is not the same as "OTA is safe to ship."

## Bring Up a Custom Display Module

**Goal:** port a new LCD, AMOLED, EPD, or memory display instead of using a pre-supported reference panel.

**Time:** 3+ hours

**Start from:** the closest existing display driver in the SDK, adapted for your panel

1. Collect the panel datasheet, initialization sequence, timing parameters, interface type, reset requirements, and power sequence.
2. Confirm the selected SF32 device and package support the required interface and pinout.
3. Copy the closest existing display driver and replace the panel-specific init sequence and register map.
4. Bring up solid-color fills first. Do not debug LVGL widgets until the panel can display simple patterns.
5. Verify color order, byte order, orientation, address window, and partial update behavior.
6. Add LVGL back from Connected Subsystems, exercise 2.
7. Enable DMA, partial refresh, and ePicasso acceleration one at a time.
8. Test display-off, sleep, wake, and reinitialization paths.

**Success criteria:** the panel initializes reliably after cold boot and reset, renders known patterns correctly, and survives sleep/wake without corruption.

**Troubleshooting:** if fills are wrong, check pixel format, MADCTL/orientation bits, byte order, command/data wiring, reset timing, and power-rail sequencing before changing UI code.

**What you learned:** how to separate electrical/sequence correctness from UI-framework configuration.

## Profile CPU Usage and Analyze a Crash

**Goal:** debug problems that do not reproduce conveniently under a live debugger.

**Time:** 2 hours

**Start from:** `example/system/cpu_usage_profiler`, `example/system/coredump`

1. Run the CPU usage profiler example against one of your Connected Subsystems combined workloads.
2. Identify which task is consuming CPU time and whether it matches your expectation.
3. Add a controlled fault in a practice branch or disposable example and capture a core dump.
4. Use the SDK's dump-analysis tooling to locate the faulting function and call stack.
5. Compare the crash context with `list_thread`, logs, and recent events.
6. Remove the deliberate fault and repeat the flow with a real intermittent issue if you have one.

**Success criteria:** you can explain both a performance problem and a crash using captured evidence rather than guesses.

**Troubleshooting:** make sure symbols match the flashed binary, logs include firmware version, and optimization level is understood before interpreting call stacks.

**What you learned:** proactive profiling for slow paths and postmortem dump analysis for failures that are hard to catch live.

## Build a Multi-Connection BLE Product

**Goal:** support more than one simultaneous BLE role or connection.

**Time:** 2 hours

**Start from:** `example/ble/central_and_peripheral`, `example/ble/multi_connection`

1. Start from the peripheral behavior you already have from Connected Subsystems, exercise 3.
2. Add a central role alongside it, such as acting as a peripheral to a phone while acting as a central to a sensor accessory.
3. Extend to multiple concurrent connections.
4. Record connection intervals, slave latency, supervision timeout, and notification rate for each link.
5. Add a throughput baseline using the SDK throughput example before blaming application code.
6. Test reconnect, phone sleep, accessory loss, and simultaneous notification bursts.

**Success criteria:** all intended roles connect, disconnect, and reconnect reliably, and connection-parameter choices remain stable under combined activity.

**Troubleshooting:** look for incompatible parameter requests, too much notification traffic, blocking application callbacks, and power policy that wakes the main CPU for every link event.

**What you learned:** peripheral and central roles are not mutually exclusive on SF32, and connection-parameter tradeoffs compound once multiple links share the radio schedule.

## Write a Custom RT-Thread Device Driver

**Goal:** integrate a peripheral that does not have an existing SDK driver as a proper RT-Thread device rather than a one-off application hack.

**Time:** 3+ hours

**Start from:** SDK application-development guidance plus the closest existing driver

1. Review how the SDK organizes board definitions, pin mux, clocks, and peripheral drivers.
2. Start from the existing driver that is architecturally closest to your peripheral.
3. Keep bus access, device registration, configuration, and application logic separated.
4. Register the device and confirm it appears under `list_device`.
5. Exercise it the same way you exercised ADC, PWM, I2C, and storage devices in earlier tutorials.
6. Add error handling for missing hardware, invalid arguments, timeouts, and suspend/resume.
7. If the driver is reusable, package it as an SDK component instead of copy-pasting it between products.

**Success criteria:** application code can find and use the driver through the normal RT-Thread device model, and the driver behaves predictably across init, use, error, and sleep/wake paths.

**Troubleshooting:** if the driver works only from one application file, it is probably bypassing the device model. Refactor until it feels like the built-in devices.

**What you learned:** how to extend the SDK ecosystem cleanly rather than creating a maintenance liability.

## Where to Go Next

At this point you have the full toolkit: peripherals, middleware, coexistence awareness, power discipline, OTA, custom hardware bring-up, postmortem debugging, and driver integration. From here, the [Examples](../../develop/examples/index.md) catalog and [Graphics Overview](../../learn/graphics/overview.md) are ongoing references. Pull from them per feature rather than working through them linearly.
