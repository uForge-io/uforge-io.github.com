# SF32LB52x

## Overview

SF32LB52x is SiFli's cost-optimized MCU family for entry-level smart wearables, compact graphical HMIs, Bluetooth peripherals, and other space-constrained AIoT products that still need integrated display, audio, storage, and wireless capability.

At the platform level, the family combines a 240MHz Arm Cortex-M33 STAR-MC1 application core with a dedicated 24MHz low-power Bluetooth controller core, enabling the chip to run a responsive UI and application stack while keeping Bluetooth connectivity and always-on workloads separate.

For product planning, the important distinction is that SF32LB52 is split into two supply-oriented subfamilies:

- **SF32LB520/3/5/7**: lithium-ion battery-powered variants with an integrated charger path
- **SF32LB52B/D/E/G/J**: external-supply variants, where 52B/E/G/J target standard 3.3V systems and **52D** targets a special 1.8V ultra-low-power rail

These groups are not interchangeable at the board level. The battery-powered and external-supply families are not pin compatible with each other, and the 1.8V 52D variant is also electrically distinct from the 3.3V 52B/E/G/J group even where package alignment looks similar.

[^1]: STAR-MC1 is a configurable Armv8-M Mainline embedded CPU IP from Arm China. In compatible SF32 devices, SiFli documents it as an Arm Cortex-M33 STAR-MC1 application processor. Its Cortex-M33-class software model helps existing Cortex-M33 firmware, middleware, RTOS ports, and tools carry forward, subject to normal device-specific integration work. Its CU, SP, and SE configurations vary chiefly in cache, TCM, XIPU, and TrustZone capability; Arm Custom Instructions/CDE and the coprocessor interface are optional capabilities that must be verified for the exact SF32 part. SiFli documentation may use ***Arm Cortex-M33 STAR-MC1*** or ***Arm Cortex-M33*** according to context.

## Applications

**SF32LB52x is recommended for** Bluetooth-centric products where cost, integration, and battery life are the primary design considerations, including:

- Entry-level smartwatches and fitness bands
- Bluetooth modules and wireless adapters
- Bluetooth audio accessories
- Smart sensors and wearable devices
- Electronic shelf labels and smart badges
- Portable label printers
- eBike and eScooter displays
- Basic LVGL-based HMI devices

### Power Supply

- **Battery-powered group: SF32LB520/3/5/7** — powered directly from a single-cell Li-ion/Li-Po battery and intended for designs that use the integrated charging-oriented power architecture.

- **External-supply 3.3V group: SF32LB52B/E/G/J** — intended for regulated external-supply systems and pin compatible with one another.

- **External-supply 1.8V group: SF32LB52D** — intended for special ultra-low-power 1.8V designs and not electrically interchangeable with the 3.3V parts.

The battery-powered and external-supply groups are independent silicon configurations and are **not pin compatible** across those supply families.

## Family Variants

<div align="center"><em>SF32LB52x Family Variants</em></div>

The practical part-selection split is:

- **SF32LB520/3/5/7**: lithium-ion battery-powered group, pin compatible within the group
- **SF32LB52B/E/G/J**: standard 3.3V external-supply group, pin compatible within the group
- **SF32LB52D**: special 1.8V external-supply variant for ultra-low-power scenarios

If you are migrating between memory tiers, the nearest content-correspondence map is:

- 520 ↔ 52B
- 523 ↔ 52E, with 52D as the 1.8V counterpart
- 525 ↔ 52G
- 527 ↔ 52J

## Integration Path

Use this sequence to turn an SF32LB52x shortlist into a validated design:

1. **Prove the firmware path.** Start with the [SiFli SDK getting-started guide](../../getting-started/sifli/getting-started-sifli-sdk.md), then use the [SiFli SDK workflow](../../develop/platforms/sifli-sdk/overview.md) and [examples](../../develop/examples/index.md) to validate the required peripherals and Bluetooth behavior.
2. **Choose the integration vehicle.** Evaluate [SF32LB52-MOD-1](../modules/SF32LB52-MOD-1.md) when a ready-integrated RF module suits the product; otherwise select the closest [SF32LB52 development board](../devkits/SF32LB52-DevKit-LCD.md) for early firmware and peripheral validation.
3. **Design and review the hardware.** Use the local [hardware design guide](../../hardware/chip-guides/SF32LB52x_hardware_design_guide.md) — including its [schematic](../../hardware/chip-guides/SF32LB52x_schematic_checklist.md) and [PCB layout](../../hardware/chip-guides/SF32LB52x_pcb_layout_checklist.md) checklists — before releasing the schematic or layout. Confirm the correct supply-family baseline: 520/3/5/7, 52B/E/G/J, or 52D.
4. **Verify the authoritative source.** Check the applicable [datasheet](#development-resources) and SiFli [hardware design guide for 520/3/5/7] or [hardware design guide for 52B/D/E/G/J] against the exact orderable part and package.
