</div>

## 5. Schematic Design

### 5.1 Power System

#### 5.1.1 Power Supply

<div align="center"><em>Table 5.1-1: Power Rails</em></div>

<div align="center" markdown>

| Rail | Recommended Operating Range | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| VDD_3V3 | 2.97–3.6V | MCU PVDD, analog 3.3V domains, RF analog domain, VDDIOA2, internal Flash. |
| VDD_1V8 | 1.7–1.95V | MCU co-packaged memory supply. |
| VDDIO | 1.7–3.6V | MCU VDDIOA/VDDIOB I/O supply. |

</div>

VDD_3V3, VDD_1V8, and VDDIO must power up at the same time. Place a 4.7uF capacitor close to each module power pin. Although VDDIO can operate from 1.7V to 3.6V, the datasheet separately notes that PA00–PA11 are fixed at 3.3V and do not follow VDDIO.

#### 5.1.2 Operating Modes

BOOT_MODE selects boot behavior: high for download mode and low for user mode. Keep the BOOT_MODE network deterministic during reset and production programming. PB32/PWRKEY supports active-high 10s long-press reset and requires a 10k pulldown.

### 5.2 Timing and RF

#### 5.2.1 Clock

The module platform uses a 48MHz crystal oscillator and supports low-power RC oscillators at 1MHz/48MHz, an ultra-low-power 10kHz RC oscillator, and an optional 32.768kHz crystal oscillator. Keep clock-related layout and grounding consistent with the module reference design and avoid ultrasonic processes that can mechanically stress the internal crystal.

#### 5.2.2 RF

<div align="center"><em>Table 5.2-1: Bluetooth RF Summary</em></div>

<div align="center" markdown>

| Item | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| Bluetooth frequency range | 2402–2480MHz |
| BLE maximum transmit power | 19dBm |
| BLE RF power-control range | -20 to 19dBm |
| BLE 1Mbps sensitivity | -100dBm dirty off, -99.3dBm dirty on |
| BLE 2Mbps sensitivity | -97dBm dirty off, -96.5dBm dirty on |
| BR maximum transmit power | 19dBm |
| EDR maximum transmit power | 13dBm |
| BR sensitivity | -96.3dBm dirty off, -94dBm dirty on |
| EDR2 sensitivity | -95.5dBm dirty off, -95dBm dirty on |
| EDR3 sensitivity | -88.5dBm dirty off, -87dBm dirty on |

</div>

The module supports PCB on-board antenna or an external antenna through an IPEX-compatible connector. Validate communication distance and RF performance in the final enclosure, not only on an open bench.

### 5.3 User Interfaces

#### 5.3.1 Display

The LCD controller supports DBI serial SPI mode, Dual-SPI, Quad-SPI, 8080 parallel mode, DPI/RGB, and JDI. The recommended pin-assignment figure in the datasheet maps LCD_DPI_24, LCD_DPI_8, LCD_QSPI, LCD_8080, E-Paper, and Raspberry Pi-style groups to module pins.

Add 33–100 ohm series resistors on LCD RGB signal lines. Keep RGB, SPI display, and touch-panel routing short and consistent, and reserve ESD protection on exposed touch or connector interfaces.

!!! info "Figure 5.3-1: Recommended Development-Board Pin Assignment"
    See Figure 7-6 in DS5602 V0.3.

#### 5.3.2 Audio

The module exposes analog audio DAC outputs, MIC_BIAS, MIC_ADC_IN, I2S, and PDM-capable pins. The audio DAC is a 24-bit output path supporting 8kHz to 48kHz sample rates with 109dB SNR and dynamic range. The audio ADC is a 24-bit Sigma-Delta input path supporting 8kHz to 48kHz sample rates with 99dB SNR and dynamic range.

Route analog audio away from noisy switching nodes, LCD clocks, and antenna feed structures. Keep MIC_BIAS and MIC_ADC_IN filtering close to the attached microphone circuit.

#### 5.3.3 Buttons

PB32 is the PWRKEY input and supports active-high 10s long-press reset. Add the required 10k pulldown and ensure the button circuit cannot float during shipping, deep sleep, or power sequencing.

#### 5.3.4 Motor and PWM Loads

Pins marked GPTIM in the datasheet's recommended pin-assignment figure support PWM output. Use external drivers for motors, backlights, buzzers, or other loads; do not drive inductive or high-current loads directly from module GPIO.

### 5.4 Storage and Connectivity

#### 5.4.1 Storage

The module family provides SKU-dependent main Flash, 4+8MB OPI-PSRAM, and 1MB backup QSPI-NOR Flash. MPI3 can connect SPI NOR or SPI NAND externally, but PA06–PA11 are connected to module internal Flash by default and are unavailable externally. SDIO and MPI3 share I/O resources and cannot be used at the same time.

#### 5.4.2 Sensors

GPADC supports 12-bit conversion, up to 4MS/s sample rate, 0–3.3V single-ended input range, -2.1V to +2.1V differential input range, software/hardware trigger, and DMA. Pins marked GPADC_CHx support analog input; keep analog routes short, filtered, and away from LCD and RF switching noise.

#### 5.4.3 UART/I2C

UART supports full-duplex operation up to 6Mbps. I2C supports standard 100kbps, fast 400kbps, fast-mode plus 1Mbps, and high-speed 3.4Mbps modes. Many GPIOs are multiplexed as `PAxx_I2C_UART` or `PBxx_I2C_UART`; confirm the final mux plan before schematic freeze.

UART4_TXD on pin 6 and UART4_RXD on pin 7 are the default print serial port and support program download/debug. PA16 and PA17 can be multiplexed as DBG_UART and require 100 ohm series resistors when used for program download/debug.

#### 5.4.4 USB, SPI, SDIO, and I2S

USB2.0 FS supports Host/Device mode with integrated PHY. SPI supports SSP/SPI and Microwire formats; HPSYS SPI reaches up to 48MHz and LPSYS SPI up to 24MHz. SDMMC1 supports SD 3.0, SDIO 3.0, and eMMC 4.5.1 with SDR and DDR modes; SDMMC2 supports SD/SDIO/eMMC functions with SDR modes up to 48MHz. I2S supports master/slave, full duplex, left/right/standard formats, and up to 24-bit PCM width.

### 5.5 Manufacturing

#### 5.5.1 Debug

SWDIO on pin 79 and SWCLK on pin 80 are SWD debug/download pins. Keep SWD accessible on early prototypes and production fixtures. Also expose the default UART4 download/debug path unless the product has another approved programming path.

#### 5.5.2 Production

Reserve production access for power, ground, boot mode, reset/PWRKEY, SWD, UART download, and any board-level calibration or RF test interface. Final test software should cover boot, Flash, display, touch, audio, USB, sensors, RF communication, sleep/wake behavior, and current consumption.

## 6. PCB Layout

### 6.1 Mechanical and Footprint

The module measures 18.0 × 32.9 × 3.1mm. Use the recommended PCB footprint from the datasheet and verify the land pattern, solder-mask expansion, paste opening, keep-out, and assembly courtyard with the PCB assembly vendor.

!!! info "Figure 6.1-1: SF32LB56-MOD Module Dimensions"
    See Figure 8-1 in DS5602 V0.3.

!!! info "Figure 6.1-2: Recommended PCB Footprint"
    See Figure 8-2 in DS5602 V0.3. Dimensions are in millimeters.

### 6.2 Antenna Placement

If the product uses the PCB on-board antenna, reserve the antenna area with no components or metal. Place the module so the antenna area extends beyond the carrier-board edge when possible, with the feed point close to the board edge.

If the antenna cannot extend beyond the board edge, provide a clearance area of at least 15mm. Do not place copper, traces, or components in that clearance, and cut away the carrier-board material under the PCB antenna as much as practical.

!!! info "Figure 6.2-1: Recommended Module Placement"
    See Figure 8-4 in DS5602 V0.3.

!!! info "Figure 6.2-2: PCB Antenna Clearance Area"
    See Figure 8-5 in DS5602 V0.3.

### 6.3 External Antenna Connector

For external antenna designs, the datasheet describes a first-generation external antenna connector compatible with Hirose U.FL series, I-PEX MHF I, and Amphenol AMC connectors.

!!! info "Figure 6.3-1: External Antenna Connector Dimensions"
    See Figure 8-3 in DS5602 V0.3.
