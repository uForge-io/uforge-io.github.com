# SF32LB52x Hardware Design Guide — Schematic Design Guidelines

!!! note "Part of the SF32LB52x Hardware Design Guide"
    Schematic Design Guidelines now spans three pages: this page (Sections 5.1-5.3: Minimum System, Power, and Clock), [RF & User Interfaces](SF32LB52x_schematic_rf_interfaces.md) (Sections 5.4-5.5), and [Storage & Manufacturing](SF32LB52x_schematic_storage_mfg.md) (Sections 5.6-5.7). Start from the [SF32LB52x Hardware Design Guide overview](SF32LB52x_hardware_design_guide.md) for device selection and the full design flow, or see the [Schematic Checklist](SF32LB52x_schematic_checklist.md) for the item-by-item review.

## 5. Schematic Design Guidelines

This chapter follows the schematic workflow across three pages. Complete the minimum-system review first, then expand into clock generation on this page; RF and user interfaces on the next page; and storage, manufacturing access, and PCB-dependent decisions on the final page. For each major block, confirm the design goal and variant scope before checking circuit requirements, pin assignment, common mistakes, and release checklist items.

### 5.1. Minimum System Design

Minimum system design is the first schematic release gate for an SF32LB52x board. It covers the decisions that must be correct before product peripherals are added: exact device variant, package, power tree, boot medium, bootstrap resistors, storage power control, debug/download access, clock sources, and wake behavior. A board can often tolerate late changes to display or sensor wiring; it usually cannot tolerate a wrong storage strap, missing debug access, unstable rail, or incompatible power-state assumption.

Use the following sequence for the first schematic pass:

1. Select the exact device and package from Section 3.2 and Section 3.3.
2. Choose the correct power path: `SF32LB520/3/5/7` for rechargeable battery-powered products, or `52B/D/E/G/J` for externally regulated products.
3. Lock the power-system decisions in Section 5.2, including `VBUS`/`VBAT`/`VCC` or `PVDD`/`VDDIOA`/`VDD_SIP`, BUCK, internal LDO decoupling, RF/audio rails, and all low-power load switches.
4. Select the boot medium and populate `PA13`/`PA17` bootstrap pull options to match the boot table in Section 5.6.1.
5. Route all boot-storage power switches to `PA21`, including large NOR Flash designs that must exit 4-byte mode after restart or Hibernate.
6. Reserve `PA18`/`PA19`, ground, and a valid power reference for DBG_UART/SWD access before the enclosure and production fixture are frozen.
7. Select the 48 MHz and 32.768 kHz crystals from Section 5.3.1 and keep their placement constraints visible during schematic review.
8. Assign wake pins, power-key behavior, charger events, and storage/sensor shutdown states before firmware low-power policy is finalized.

At the end of this gate, the schematic should be able to power up, boot from the selected medium, expose a recovery path, run clock calibration, and enter the intended low-power state without relying on optional product peripherals.

### 5.2. Power System

Power-system design defines the rails, load switches, charger path, OVP, internal LDO usage, wake behavior, and low-power states that make the minimum system reliable. Complete this section before PCB placement, because later display, storage, RF, audio, and sensor decisions depend on these rail assumptions.

#### 5.2.1. Power Supply

**Quick Summary**

- Battery-powered devices use the `SF32LB520/3/5/7` path with `VBUS`, `VBAT`, `VCC`, charging, and OVP decisions.
- Regular-powered devices use the `52B/D/E/G/J` path with externally regulated `PVDD`, `VDDIOA`, `VDD_SIP`, and no internal charging path.
- BUCK inductor, internal LDO decoupling, RF/audio rails, and standby load switches must be fixed before PCB placement.

**Design Goal**

Create a stable, low-leakage power tree that supports the selected variant, avoids overloading internal LDO outputs, keeps RF and audio rails quiet, and allows unused loads and boot storage to be switched off in low-power modes.

    !!! important "Hibernate mode note"
        When the system enters Hibernate mode, VDD_SIP must be switched off, otherwise there is a leakage risk on the I/O of the co-packaged storage. Use the dedicated PA21 pin to control the VDD_SIP power switch.

##### 5.2.1.2. BUCK Inductor Selection

Both design groups use the same inductor specification.

!!! important "Key Power Inductor Parameters"
    L (inductance) = 4.7 uH ± 20%, DCR (DC resistance) ≤ 0.4 Ω, Isat (saturation current) ≥ 450 mA.

##### 5.2.1.3. Battery and Charging Control

=== "SF32LB520/3/5/7 (Battery-Powered)"

    There are two charging-circuit scenarios: an external charging management chip, or the on-chip integrated charging management module.

    **External Charging Management Chip**

    External charging chips come in two common types: without PPM (power path management) and with PPM. Without PPM, the battery directly supplies the VBAT and VCC pins. With PPM, the charger's VSYS supplies VCC, and the charger's VBAT connects to both the battery and the chip's VBAT pin. Both approaches measure battery voltage through the VBAT pin, which has an integrated GPADC channel with sampling accuracy within ±30 mV.

    ![Figure 5.2-1: External Charging Circuit without PPM](../../sf32-products/chips/assets/52xA/sf32lb52x-CHG-NPPM.png){ width="100%" loading="lazy" }

    <div align="center"><em>Figure 5.2-1: External Charging Circuit without PPM</em></div>

    <div align="center"><em>Figure 5.2-2: External Charging Circuit with PPM</em></div>

    **On-Chip Integrated Charging Management Module**

    When using the integrated charging module, if the battery is low and the device is off, plugging in a charger requires the battery to charge up to the power-on threshold before the system can boot and display the charging screen.

    ![Figure 5.2-3: Integrated Charging Management Circuit](../../sf32-products/chips/assets/52xA/sf32lb52x-CHG-INNER.png){ width="100%" loading="lazy" }

    <div align="center"><em>Figure 5.2-3: Integrated Charging Management Circuit</em></div>

    **OVP Chip Selection (When Using the Integrated Charging Module)**

    The VBUS input range is 4.5 V–5.5 V, so choose one of these OVP chip types:

    - Adjustable-OVLO OVP chip, e.g. AW32905FCR — set OVLO between 5.2 V and 5.5 V (VOVLO_TH tolerance ≤3%, resistor tolerance ≤1%)
    - Regulated-output OVP chip, e.g. SGM4064YDE8G or LP5305AQVF — regulator output must be between 4.5 V and 5.5 V

    <div align="center"><em>Figure 5.2-6: Regulated-Output OVP Application Circuit</em></div>

    !!! important "Integrated Charging Module Notes"
        - VBUS input range: 4.6 V–5.5 V
        - VCC input range: 3.2 V–4.7 V
        - Default trickle current: 56 mA, trickle-to-constant-current transition voltage: 3.0 V
        - Default constant charge current: 65 mA, adjustable 5–560 mA
        - Default full-charge voltage: 4.2 V, adjustable up to 4.45 V
        - Recharge voltage: full-charge voltage - 0.15 V
        - The charger's VBUS must supply at least 350 mA; VBUS pin voltage must not drop below 4.6 V at maximum charge current
        - For wireless charging, ensure the wireless charger's supply capability exceeds the constant charge current

    !!! important "Integrated LDO Notes"
        - Total capacitance on the VDD33_VOUT1 and VDD33_VOUT2 output paths must not exceed 9.6 uF
        - AVDD33_AUD must be powered from VDD33_VOUT1, not from VSYS
        - The LCD must not be powered from the internal LDO — use an external LDO

=== "52B/D/E/G/J (Regular-Powered)"

    !!! info "Not Applicable"
        The regular-powered variant is powered directly from a regulated external supply and **has no charging management circuitry**. This section does not apply. If your product needs battery power and charging, use the SF32LB520/3/5/7 series instead.

##### 5.2.1.4. Reducing Standby Power

=== "SF32LB520/3/5/7 (Battery-Powered)"

    Recommended power structure: **VDD33_VOUT2** supplies the vibration motor, **VDD33_VOUT1** supplies external Flash and sensors, and the LCD uses an external LDO.

    ![Figure 5.2-7: SF32LB52x System Power Structure Diagram](../../sf32-products/chips/assets/52xA/sf32lb52x-PWR-diagram.png){ width="100%" loading="lazy" }

    <div align="center"><em>Figure 5.2-7: SF32LB52x System Power Structure Diagram</em></div>

    Control the default hardware state of power-switch GPIO pins carefully, and add megohm-range pull-up/pull-down resistors so load switches default to off. For LDO and load-switch selection, choose devices with low quiescent current (Iq) and low shutdown current (Istb), and pay particular attention to Iq on always-on power devices.

=== "52B/D/E/G/J (Regular-Powered)"

    Use load switches for dynamic power management of each functional block; for always-on modules or paths, select devices with low quiescent current.

    Control the default hardware state of power-switch GPIO pins carefully, and add megohm-range pull-up/pull-down resistors so load switches default to off. For LDO and load-switch selection, choose devices with low quiescent current (Iq) and low shutdown current (Istb), and pay particular attention to Iq on always-on power devices.

##### 5.2.1.5. Power Design Checklist

- [ ] Confirmed which power variant (battery-powered / regular-powered) matches the exact chip model
- [ ] BUCK inductor meets 4.7 uH ±20%, DCR ≤0.4 Ω, Isat ≥450 mA
- [ ] All internal LDO decoupling capacitors are placed per requirements
- [ ] LCD power is isolated and not fed directly from the internal LDO
- [ ] Audio and RF power rails are properly filtered
- [ ] Battery-powered variant: charging path and OVP device voltage ranges verified; regular-powered variant: VDD_SIP/VDDIOA supply configured correctly for the chip model

**Common Mistakes - Power**

- Powering the LCD directly from an internal LDO instead of an external LDO.
- Mixing battery-powered and regular-powered supply assumptions in the same schematic.
- Leaving `VDD_SIP` powered during Hibernate on variants where storage leakage is a risk.
- Choosing a charger or OVP device without verifying the worst-case VBUS current and voltage range.

**Bring-Up Checks - Power**

- Measure `VCC`/`PVDD`, BUCK output, RF/audio rails, and storage supply before firmware enables peripherals.
- Confirm charger attach, trickle charge, constant-current charge, and recharge behavior on battery-powered designs.
- Measure standby and Hibernate current with display, sensors, storage, and motor load switches off.

#### 5.2.2. Operating Modes and Wake Sources

**Quick Summary**

- Active and Sleep retain fast interrupt response; DeepSleep and Standby trade wake time for lower current.
- Hibernate is the lowest-power state, but SRAM is not retained and some external supplies must be shut down.
- Wake-capable GPIO selection affects buttons, touch interrupt, charger events, and sensor wake behavior.

**Design Goal**

Select wake sources and external power-switch defaults so the product can enter the intended low-power state without leakage paths or missing wake events.

!!! note "Shared Design"
    Operating modes and wake-source behavior apply across the SF32LB52x family unless a product-specific power tree intentionally disables an external wake source.

| Mode | CPU | Peripherals | SRAM | IO | LPTIM | Wake Source | Wake Time |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| Active | Run | Run | Accessible | Can toggle | Run | - | - |
| Sleep | Stop | Run | Accessible | Can toggle | Run | Any interrupt | <0.5 us |

**Operating-Mode Checklist**

- [ ] Required wake pins are assigned before pin-mux is frozen.
- [ ] Pull states on wake pins are compatible with Standby and Hibernate.
- [ ] External storage and sensor supplies do not leak through I/O pins in Hibernate.
- [ ] Firmware and hardware teams agree which state is used for shipping, shelf, and normal standby modes.

### 5.3. Clock Generation

#### 5.3.1. Crystal Selection

**Quick Summary**

- Use a 48 MHz main crystal and a 32.768 kHz RTC crystal.
- Favor low CL and low ESR parts from the AVL to reduce startup and static current.
- Keep crystal traces short, shielded, and away from heat, RF, charger, PMU, and DC/DC noise.

**Design Goal**

Provide stable, low-jitter clock sources while minimizing oscillator current, frequency drift, RF interference, and bring-up risk.

The chip requires two external clock sources: a 48 MHz main crystal and a 32.768 kHz RTC crystal. Requirements are identical for both variants.

!!! important "Crystal Specification Requirements"
    <div align="center"><em>Table 5.3-1: Crystal Specification Requirements</em></div>

    <div align="center" markdown>

    | Crystal | Requirement | Notes |
    |:---|:---|:---|
    | 48 MHz | 7 pF ≤ CL ≤ 12 pF (8.8 pF recommended), ΔF/F0 ≤ ±10 ppm, ESR ≤ 30 Ω (22 Ω recommended) | Lower CL and ESR reduce power consumption; matching capacitors are typically unnecessary when CL < 12 pF |
    | 32.768 kHz | CL ≤ 12.5 pF (7 pF recommended), ΔF/F0 ≤ ±20 ppm, ESR ≤ 80 kΩ (38 kΩ recommended) | Lower CL and ESR reduce power consumption; matching capacitors are typically unnecessary when CL < 12.5 pF |

| SF32K32768D71T01 | TKD | F0=32.768 kHz, ΔF/F0=-20~20 ppm, CL=7 pF, ESR≤70 kΩ, TOPR=-40~85°C, 3215 metric package |

</div>

!!! note "Additional Notes"
    The TKD SX20Y048000B31T-8.8 has a somewhat higher ESR, which slightly increases static power consumption. During PCB layout, remove the second-layer ground copper directly under the crystal to reduce parasitic load capacitance on the clock signal.

For the complete, continuously maintained qualification data, refer to the [SiFli Approved Vendor List][SiFli Approved Vendor List (AVL)].

**Common Mistakes - Clock**

- Selecting a crystal only by frequency and package, without checking CL, ESR, tolerance, and temperature range.
- Placing the crystal near PA, charger, PMU, RF matching, or other heat/noise sources.
- Leaving copper or high-speed routing under the crystal keep-out region.
- Making 32 kHz traces long and parallel without spacing or ground shielding.

**Clock Checklist**

- [ ] 48 MHz and 32.768 kHz crystals match AVL/datasheet requirements.
- [ ] Crystal load capacitance and ESR are verified against the oscillator limits.
- [ ] Keep-out, trace length, trace width, spacing, and ground shielding are checked in PCB review.
- [ ] Bring-up plan includes measuring 48 MHz, 32 kHz, and Bluetooth frequency calibration behavior.
