# SF32LB58x Hardware Design Guide

## 1. Introduction

This hardware design guide provides recommendations and reference material for products based on the SF32LB58x family of high-performance AIoT microcontrollers. It is intended for hardware engineers, PCB designers, and product developers building battery-powered products with rich user interfaces, large memory, dual-mode Bluetooth, audio, high GPIO count, and low-power standby requirements.

The guide covers the complete hardware development process, including PMIC and power distribution, BGA256 fanout, HDI stack-up planning, clock circuits, RF design, MIPI-DSI, USB2.0 High-Speed, SDIO/eMMC, audio circuits, PCB layout, validation, and manufacturing preparation. Following these guidelines helps reduce risk in dense BGA/HDI designs, protect signal integrity on high-speed interfaces, and keep the product aligned with the SF32LB58x power, package, and production requirements.

This document assumes a basic understanding of embedded hardware design, schematic capture, and high-density PCB layout. It complements the SF32LB58x datasheet, user manual, official hardware application note, reference design package, and SiFli Approved Vendor List, which remain the authority for electrical specifications, pin multiplexing, package dimensions, component qualification, and production limits.

## 3. Device Overview

### 3.1. Architecture

<div align="center"><em>Table 3.1-1: Major Hardware Feature Summary</em></div>

<div align="center" markdown>

| Feature | Description |
|:---|:---|
| Core architecture | Heterogeneous triple-core architecture: 2x application Arm Cortex-M33 STAR-MC1 cores up to 240 MHz and 1x low-power Arm Cortex-M33 STAR-MC1 core up to 96 MHz |
| Bluetooth | Integrated low-power Bluetooth 6.3 transceiver |
| Graphics | ePicasso 2.0 2D/2.5D graphics acceleration and Vivante GCNanoUltraV vector graphics |
| Display interfaces | MIPI-DSI, SPI/QSPI, MCU8080, DPI, parallel/serial JDI |
| Storage | Model-dependent co-packaged NOR Flash/PSRAM, plus external MPI4, SD1, and SD2 interfaces |
| Audio | 3x I2S, 2x PDM, differential analog audio input/output, external analog audio PA and I2S audio PA support |
| Wake interrupts | 16 wake-capable interrupt sources in Standby/Hibernate mode: 6 on PA and 10 on PB |
| PBR interface | 6 general-purpose PBR pins for LSW control, 32 kHz clock output, or wake input |

</div>

### 3.2. Variants

Specific SF32LB58x ordering codes and co-packaged memory combinations should be confirmed from the latest datasheet and AVL before schematic freeze. From a board-design perspective, treat the whole SF32LB58x family as a BGA256, HDI-only platform with model-dependent SIP memory and external storage options through MPI4, SD1, and SD2.

### 3.3. Packages
<div align="center"><em>Table 3.3-1: Package</em></div>

<div align="center" markdown>

| Package Name | Dimensions | Pin Pitch |
|:---|:---|:---|
| BGA256 | 8.5 mm x 6.5 mm x 0.94 mm | 0.4 mm |

</div>

### 3.4. Major Hardware Features

- BGA256 package with 0.4 mm pitch and dense power/GPIO fanout.
- HDI PCB process required; the design is not PTH-compatible.
- Integrated PMU with 2 BUCK outputs and 3 internal LDO outputs.
- Optional system PMIC SF30147C for watch-class system power distribution.
- MIPI-DSI, USB2.0 HS, SDIO/eMMC, RF, audio, and dense BGA fanout require early stack-up and impedance confirmation.

### 3.5. Typical Applications

SF32LB58x is recommended for premium connected products that need advanced graphics, large memory, high GPIO count, multimedia, and edge AI capability, including:

- Premium smartwatches, sports watches, and outdoor wearables
- Advanced cycling computers and vehicle-mounted dashboards
- Smart displays and connected dashboards
- AI-enabled wearable devices
- Edge AI and sensor-fusion systems
- High-resolution LVGL-based HMI devices
- Portable medical and industrial terminals
- Bluetooth + Wi-Fi accessories that use an external SDIO Wi-Fi device

### 4.2. Hardware Design Flow

<div align="center"><em>Table 4.2-1: Hardware Design Flow</em></div>

<div align="center" markdown>

| Step | Design Decision | Primary Sections |
|:---|:---|:---|
| 1 | Confirm ordering code, SIP memory configuration, and BGA256 package assumptions | Device Overview, Packages |
| 2 | Freeze HDI stack-up, via structure, impedance rules, and assembly capability before layout starts | PCB Layout Guidelines |
| 3 | Define the SF30147C/system PMIC strategy, chip PMU rails, BUCK inductors, LDO capacitors, reset, and power sequencing | Power System |
| 4 | Select boot storage, display interface, USB role, SDIO/eMMC usage, audio topology, and debug access | Storage and Connectivity, User Interfaces, Manufacturing |
| 5 | Review clock, RF, DSI, USB2.0 HS, SDIO/eMMC, audio, DC/DC, BGA fanout, and ESD routing screenshots | Clock Generation, RF, PCB Layout Guidelines |
| 6 | Archive schematic, stack-up, DRC, impedance, AVL, manufacturing, and focused layout evidence before prototype release | Design Review Checklist |

</div>

### 4.3. How to Use This Guide

Use this guide in board-review order: confirm the package and SIP-memory configuration, lock the HDI stack-up and PMIC strategy, review boot storage and display routing, then verify clocks, RF, USB, audio, debug, and production test access. Section 5 is the schematic baseline, Section 6 is the PCB implementation baseline, and Section 7 is the release checklist.

### 4.4. Review Evidence Pack

Before prototype release, archive the schematic PDF, PCB stack-up, via/process capability statement, impedance report, DRC report, AVL cross-check, and focused layout screenshots for the PMIC, BUCK inductors, DSI, USB, SDIO/eMMC, RF, crystals, audio, BGA fanout, ground return, and ESD entry points.

## Using the Checklists

This guide includes two levels of checklist coverage. The short checklists embedded throughout Sections 5.1.1.7 and 5.6.3 give the highest-risk items for a quick engineering self-check. The [Schematic Checklist](SF32LB58x_schematic_checklist.md) (Section 5.7) and [PCB Layout Checklist](SF32LB58x_pcb_layout_checklist.md) (Section 6.18) reproduce SiFli's complete, item-by-item *SF32LB58x Schematic & PCB Checklist* (V1.0, 2026-01-21).

Each check point is Required (must pass before release) or Optional (recommended if the feature is used). Colored text and text with a <span class="flag-yellow">yellow background</span> preserve the source workbook's review emphasis; the workbook doesn't state a reason for each highlight, so treat these marks as additional review flags, not as replacements for any non-highlighted item in the same table.

Run the [Schematic Checklist](SF32LB58x_schematic_checklist.md) during schematic review, before PCB layout begins. Run the [PCB Layout Checklist](SF32LB58x_pcb_layout_checklist.md) during layout review, before Gerber release. In practice, each pass is usually performed twice: first by the design engineer, then by an independent reviewer before design freeze or manufacturing release.

For best results, treat the checklist as a sign-off record rather than a reading checklist:

1. Confirm the exact target part number and co-packaged memory configuration first.
2. Mark every item as pass / fail / not applicable during review instead of reading the table passively.
3. Cross-check display, storage, wake-up, and low-power rows against the matching hardware design guide sections.
4. Record any open assumptions in the review notes before release.
