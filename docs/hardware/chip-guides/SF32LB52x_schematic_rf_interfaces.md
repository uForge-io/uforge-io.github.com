# SF32LB52x Hardware Design Guide — RF & User Interfaces

!!! note "Part of the SF32LB52x Hardware Design Guide"
    This page covers Sections 5.4-5.5 of Schematic Design Guidelines: RF and User Interfaces. Return to [Minimum System, Power & Clock](SF32LB52x_schematic_design.md), continue to [Storage & Manufacturing](SF32LB52x_schematic_storage_mfg.md), or see the [Schematic Checklist](SF32LB52x_schematic_checklist.md) for the item-by-item review.

### 5.4. RF

#### 5.4.1. RF Schematic and Antenna Path

**Quick Summary**

- Route the antenna path as a 50 Ω controlled-impedance trace.
- Reserve a π matching network even if the selected antenna is already matched.
- Keep the RF path short, shielded, and isolated from crystal, DC/DC, display, and charger noise.

**Design Goal**

Maximize Bluetooth sensitivity and radiated performance by preserving impedance control, minimizing discontinuities, and leaving enough matching flexibility for final antenna tuning.

RF trace characteristic impedance is 50 Ω. If the antenna is already matched, no additional RF components are required, but a reserved π-type matching network is still recommended for spurious filtering or antenna tuning.

#### 5.4.2. RF Review and Tuning

**Common Mistakes - RF**

- Placing the matching network near the antenna instead of close to the chip-side RF pin.
- Routing RF through unnecessary vias or sharp bends.
- Sharing noisy ground return paths with DC/DC, display, USB, or charger circuits.
- Omitting the matching reserve and leaving no practical antenna-tuning path.

**RF Checklist**

- [ ] RF trace impedance target is defined with the PCB vendor.
- [ ] Pi matching network is reserved and placed close to the chip.
- [ ] Ground-via fence and RF keep-out are reviewed.
- [ ] Antenna tuning and certification access are planned before enclosure freeze.

### 5.5. User Interfaces

=== "SF32LB520/3/5/7 (Battery-Powered)"

    !!! info "Not Applicable"
        SiFli's official SF32LB520/3/5/7 hardware application note does not include an EPD parallel-interface reference design. If your product needs EPD display support, consult the 52B/D/E/G/J documentation and confirm feasibility for the battery-powered variant with SiFli FAE support directly.

##### 5.5.1.4. Touch and Backlight Interface

The SF32LB52x supports an I2C touch-controller interface with a touch-status interrupt input, plus one PWM signal for backlight enable and brightness control.

<div align="center"><em>Table 5.5-5: Touch and Backlight Connections</em></div>

<div align="center" markdown>

| Touch/Backlight Signal | Pin | Description |

| I2C1_SDA | PA41 | Touch I2C data |
| BL_PWM | PA01 | Backlight PWM control |
| Reset | PA44 | Touch controller reset |

</div>

**Common Mistakes - Display**

- Forgetting reset, TE, backlight PWM, or touch interrupt pins during pin assignment.
- Assuming EPD support on the battery-powered variant without confirming the actual device and source design.
- Powering the display from an internal LDO rather than an appropriately sized external rail.
- Routing display clocks and data beside crystal, RF, audio, or high-impedance analog nodes.

**Display Checklist**

- [ ] Display interface, color depth, resolution, and bandwidth match the selected panel.
- [ ] Reset, TE, backlight PWM, touch I2C, and touch interrupt are assigned and documented.
- [ ] Display power rail and sequencing are compatible with standby and wake behavior.
- [ ] Bring-up plan covers reset, panel ID/readback where available, backlight, touch interrupt, and first image.

#### 5.5.2. Audio Interface

**Quick Summary**

- The analog microphone input is single-ended and requires a DC-blocking capacitor.
- The DAC output is differential and should be routed as a short, shielded differential pair.
- Audio power filtering and MIC_BIAS placement strongly affect noise performance.

**Design Goal**

Preserve analog signal quality by keeping microphone, DAC, bias, and audio power paths short, filtered, shielded, and isolated from digital and switching-noise sources.

The shared audio interface provides:

1. One single-ended ADC input for an analog microphone, with a DC-blocking capacitor of at least 2.2 uF in series; the microphone is powered from the chip's MIC_BIAS output
2. One differential DAC output for an external audio PA — route as a differential pair with proper ground shielding; keep trace capacitance < 10 pF and length < 2 cm

<div align="center"><em>Table 5.5-6: Audio Signal Connections</em></div>

<div align="center" markdown>

| Audio Signal | Pin | Description |
|:---|:---|:---|
| BIAS | MIC_BIAS | Microphone power |
| AU_ADC1P | ADCP | Single-ended analog microphone input |
| AU_DAC1P | DACP | Differential analog output, positive |
| AU_DAC1N | DACN | Differential analog output, negative |

<div align="center"><em>Figure 5.5-3: Analog Audio PA Circuit</em></div>

**Common Mistakes - Audio**

- Routing microphone or DAC traces near display clocks, DC/DC, RF, USB, or SDIO.
- Placing MIC_BIAS or AVDD33_AUD filter capacitors far from the chip pins.
- Treating DACP/DACN as independent single-ended signals instead of a differential pair.
- Allowing high parasitic capacitance or long trace length on the analog output.

**Audio Checklist**

- [ ] MIC_BIAS, ADCP, DACP, and DACN component placement is reviewed against the layout examples.
- [ ] DACP/DACN are routed as a short, shielded differential pair.
- [ ] Audio filter capacitors are close to their pins and grounded cleanly.
- [ ] Bring-up plan covers microphone bias, ADC noise floor, DAC output, PA enable, and audible noise.

#### 5.5.3. Buttons

**Quick Summary**

- `PA34` supports the power button, power on/off behavior, and long-press reset.
- Rotary encoder buttons should follow the reference circuit and be reviewed together with wake, debounce, and ESD requirements.

**Design Goal**

Provide reliable user-input and reset behavior without false wake events, stuck reset states, or high standby leakage through pull networks.

##### 5.5.3.1. Power Button

PA34 supports long-press reset and can be designed as a combined power on/off and long-press-reset button. The long-press reset function is active-high, so the default state should be pulled low and driven high when the button is pressed.

<div align="center"><em>Figure 5.5-4: Power / Long-Press-Reset Button Circuit</em></div>

##### 5.5.3.2. Mechanical Rotary Encoder Button

Use the reference design as the baseline for the rotary encoder button circuit.

![Figure 5.5-5: Mechanical Rotary Encoder Button Circuit](../../sf32-products/chips/assets/52xB/sf32lb52X-B-XNKEY.png){ width="100%" loading="lazy" }

<div align="center"><em>Figure 5.5-5: Mechanical Rotary Encoder Button Circuit</em></div>

**Common Mistakes - Buttons**

- Leaving `PA34` floating or biased to the wrong default level.
- Forgetting that button circuits may need wake, ESD, debounce, and production-test access.
- Sharing button nets with noisy or heavily loaded functions without checking wake reliability.

**Button Checklist**

- [ ] Power/long-press-reset default level is correct.
- [ ] Wake behavior is verified for the intended low-power states.
- [ ] ESD and mechanical debounce requirements are reviewed.
- [ ] Bring-up plan includes short press, long press, wake, and reset behavior.

#### 5.5.4. Vibration Motor

**Quick Summary**

- Use a PWM output to drive the vibration motor through an external driver stage.
- Power the motor from a switchable rail where standby current matters.

**Design Goal**

Deliver repeatable haptic feedback while keeping motor surge current, switching noise, and standby leakage away from sensitive rails and wake circuits.

The SF32LB52x supports a PWM output for driving a vibration motor through an external driver stage.

<div align="center"><em>Figure 5.5-7: Vibration Motor Driver Circuit (52B/D/E/G/J Reference)</em></div>

**Motor Checklist**

- [ ] Motor driver, flyback/ESD protection, and supply current rating are reviewed.
- [ ] Motor rail default state is off in standby and shipping states.
- [ ] PWM pin assignment does not conflict with display, storage, or debug pins.
- [ ] Bring-up plan covers PWM duty sweep, start current, audible noise, and standby leakage.
