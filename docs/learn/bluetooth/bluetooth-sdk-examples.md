# Bluetooth SDK Examples { #bluetooth-sdk-examples }

The SiFli-SDK Bluetooth examples are focused starting points for a profile, role, or radio workflow; they are not drop-in product firmware. Start from the project that already proves the most constrained part of the product, make the unmodified example work on the target board, and then add one product requirement at a time.

This page organizes the [Classic Bluetooth](https://docs.sifli.com/projects/sdk/latest/sf32lb58x/example/bt/index.html), [BLE](https://docs.sifli.com/projects/sdk/latest/sf32lb58x/example/ble/index.html), and [LE Audio broadcast](https://docs.sifli.com/projects/sdk/latest/sf32lb58x/example/zbt/index.html) examples for SF32LB58x by engineering task. The official page for each project remains the authority for its SDK release, supported boards, `menuconfig` settings, build commands, test equipment, and limitations.

## Start with the Right Bluetooth Path

## Bring Up an Example as Evidence

Before changing the project, record the exact SDK version, board name, configuration, peer device or app, radio settings, and expected log. Then work through this sequence:

1. Build and flash the unmodified example for a board supported by its official page.
2. Prove the defining over-the-air behavior: discover, connect, transfer, stream, or receive as appropriate.
3. Repeat the test after reset, disconnect, reconnect, and power-cycle conditions.
4. Add one product-specific service, user-flow, audio route, or power policy at a time.
5. Retest under the product's combined workload, including display, sensors, storage, audio, and low-power transitions where applicable.

An example demonstrates a bounded workflow. It does not establish that a product's security policy, radio range, latency, power consumption, or interoperability is ready for release.

## BLE Examples

Use BLE examples for companion-app links, interoperable GATT services, beacons, data transfer, and BLE-based OTA. Select a role-oriented example first, then add a profile example only when the product needs that standardized service.

</div>

Do not treat a throughput result as a product data rate. It depends on the selected PHY, connection settings, peer behavior, RF environment, host activity, and payload pattern. Likewise, an ANCS or AMS example is a phone-integration baseline, not a guarantee for every iOS release or user permission state.

## Classic Bluetooth Examples

Classic Bluetooth projects apply to dual-mode products that need established BR/EDR profiles, audio, serial-style transport, or IP networking through a phone. They require a product-specific interoperability plan in addition to a successful development-board demonstration.

## LE Audio Broadcast Examples

The `zbt` projects focus on LE Audio Broadcast Audio Profile (BAP) roles. Treat the source and sink as a paired system test: the broadcast configuration, audio source, receiver, clocking, and RF conditions all matter to the observed result.

<div align="center"><em>Table: LE Audio Broadcast SDK Examples</em></div>

<div align="center" markdown>

| Product direction | Official example | What to establish first |
|:------------------|:-----------------|:------------------------|
| Receive a broadcast audio stream | [BAP Broadcast Sink](https://docs.sifli.com/projects/sdk/latest/sf32lb58x/example/zbt/bap_broadcast_sink/README.html) | Receiver behavior, output audio path, and the test broadcast configuration |
| Transmit a broadcast audio stream | [BAP Broadcast Source](https://docs.sifli.com/projects/sdk/latest/sf32lb58x/example/zbt/bap_broadcast_src/README.html) | Source audio pipeline, broadcast configuration, and a known-good receiver |
