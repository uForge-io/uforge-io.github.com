# SF32 BLE Talkback Intercom

## What Is Talkback?

[OpenSiFli Talkback](https://github.com/OpenSiFli/sifli-sdk-demo/tree/main/talkback) is a multi-device BLE push-to-talk (PTT) example for the `SF32LB52-DevKit-ULP`, also known as Huangshan Pi. A device can act as the Master that creates a room or as a Slave that scans for and joins one. After joining, the user holds the talk key to transmit and releases it to stop. The official baseline accommodates up to eight devices and allows up to three devices to speak concurrently.

The project uses Opus for speech coding and combines the RGB LED, keys, and display into a minimal local interface. It also implements one-key Slave reconnection, battery-voltage/level reporting, sleep after 60 seconds without input, and long-press power-off and power-on behavior. That makes it a more useful portable-intercom reference than an isolated point-to-point audio example.

## Why the SF32 Implementation?

This path combines SF32LB52 BLE, audio, display, keys, battery monitoring, and low-power behavior in one working baseline. A team can qualify networking and acoustics on supported development hardware before investing in custom RF, audio, and power design.

“Up to eight devices and three concurrent talkers” is an upstream implementation boundary, not a product claim already qualified across distance, interference, packet loss, and every concurrency pattern. Upstream material also does not specify room authentication, link-encryption policy, a voice-privacy guarantee, radio-regulatory status, or the complete licensing boundary of the binary `talk_back` component. Each requires separate product review.

## Outcome, Scope, and Entry Criteria

**Outcome:** use at least two revision-controlled boards to reproduce room creation, joining, PTT speech, leave/reconnect, sleep/wake, and battery-state behavior, then retain enough evidence to decide whether custom hardware is justified.

**Out of scope:** this page does not prove long-range coverage, degraded-link voice quality, end-to-end encryption, certification, production power, antenna consistency, regulatory compliance, or compatibility with arbitrary BLE devices.

**Entry criteria:** the team can install a SiFli-SDK build environment, download firmware over UART, inspect logs, and connect a speaker and battery safely. A complete speech baseline requires at least two boards of the same revision.

## Choose a Supported Baseline

Start with two `SF32LB52-DevKit-ULP` boards of the same revision. Pin the demo repository at `6fa55ac`, select and record a concrete SiFli-SDK commit satisfying `^2.4`, and retain the Conan resolution for `talk_back/1.2@sifli`. Do not change audio parameters, role logic, or low-power timing during the first reproduction.

From the repository root, enter the path that actually exists:

```bash
cd talkback/project
scons --board=sf32lb52-lchspi-ulp -j8
```

On Windows, the generated download script is `build_sf32lb52-lchspi-ulp_hcpu\uart_download.bat`. Run it and enter the appropriate COM port when prompted. Use the same baseline image on every device and record each board identity and image hash.

| Stage | Decision supported | Minimum evidence |
|:------|:-------------------|:-----------------|
| Establish the untouched baseline | Does the pinned set build, download, and start reliably? | Version manifest, clean-build log, image hash, and startup record |

| Qualify audio and power | Do acoustics and battery behavior fit the intended form factor? | Audio quality, latency, range, current, sleep, and wake measurements |
| Review product readiness | Is there enough evidence to fund custom hardware? | Risk register, owners, and proceed/defer/stop decision |

The principal failure domains are BLE scanning/room creation, room-state synchronization, concurrent-speaker scheduling, the Opus/acoustic path, key events, low battery and sleep, power-key recovery, and unpublished component/licensing details. Diagnose role and state first, then distinguish radio, audio, and local-power failures.

## Stage 1 — Establish the Untouched Source Baseline

**Goal:** prove that pinned source, SDK, and resolved dependencies produce a repeatable image.

1. Pin the application and a concrete SDK commit; retain dependency-resolution output.
2. Build `sf32lb52-lchspi-ulp` in a clean directory and download it to two boards.
3. Confirm that each device starts as a Slave with a solid red LED, then check the keys, display, battery, and speaker paths.

**Evidence to retain:** full version manifest, build/download logs, firmware hashes, both board revisions, and startup records.

**Gate 1 exit criterion:** the same inputs reproducibly generate and download the same baseline image to both devices, and startup state matches upstream behavior.

## Stage 2 — Validate Room Setup and Bidirectional PTT

**Goal:** prove that a user can create and use the minimum room without debugger intervention.

1. In standby, short-press KEY2 to make one device the Master with a solid blue LED; leave the other as the red Slave.
2. Long-press KEY2 on both devices: the Master creates a room and the Slave scans. Pairing times out after 30 seconds.
3. In the waiting state, long-press KEY2 on the Master to start. In the talk state, hold KEY2 to speak and release it to stop.
4. Confirm solid green while transmitting, solid orange while receiving, and intelligible speech in both directions.

**Evidence to retain:** roles, operation timeline, LED state, UART logs, bidirectional audio samples, and retry results.

**Gate 2 exit criterion:** at least two devices complete repeated bidirectional PTT sessions, indicators match the actual audio direction, and the 30-second timeout returns to an explainable state.

## Stage 3 — Validate Leave, Reconnect, and Capacity Boundaries

**Goal:** confirm that upstream recovery paths and capacity limits do not strand the user.

1. Release KEY2 before short-pressing KEY1 to leave in the talk state; a device cannot leave while it is transmitting.
2. For a Slave that joined successfully before, short-press KEY1 in standby to reconnect. The Master has no equivalent reconnect path.
3. Inject out-of-range operation, pairing timeout, Master loss, and a power restart.
4. If multi-party operation matters, scale to the intended participant count and cover the stated limits of eight devices and three concurrent speakers.

**Evidence to retain:** initial state, trigger, recovery action, recovery time, logs, and final room membership for every fault.

**Gate 3 exit criterion:** every target fault has an explicit, repeatable, user-comprehensible recovery path, and required capacity/concurrency has been measured in the target RF environment rather than copied from the limit statement.

## Stage 4 — Qualify Acoustics, RF, and Low Power

**Goal:** decide whether development-board behavior can support the intended enclosure, range, and operating time.

1. Record intelligibility, clipping, echo, and PTT start/end clipping in quiet conditions, near-end double talk, background noise, and multiple speaker-volume settings.
2. Record connection, dropouts, and recovery at target distance, through obstructions, and under 2.4 GHz interference.
3. Verify sleep after 60 seconds without input, role reset to Slave, wake on any key, long-press power-off/power-on, and the LED indication below 20% battery.
4. Measure standby, transmit, receive, sleep, and wake current; do not equate development-board measurements with final-product battery life.

**Evidence to retain:** environment, board/antenna orientation, audio files, distance and interference, current traces, battery conditions, and recovery results.

**Gate 4 exit criterion:** the product team has defined and met acoustic, RF, power, and wake thresholds for its target environment, with owners and dispositions for every miss.

## Stage 5 — Product-Readiness Review

Before custom hardware, answer at least these questions:

- How does a room identify trusted devices, and what authentication, encryption, and replay protection cover speech and control data?
- Who owns licensing, source delivery, and vulnerability response for `talk_back/1.2@sifli`, Opus, WebRTC components, and repository source files?
- What coverage, latency, packet loss, and recovery have been measured with the target antenna, enclosure, body obstruction, and concurrency?
- How will microphone, amplifier, speaker cavity, and volume limits meet acoustic and safety requirements?
- How does the device recover from low battery, abnormal power loss, corrupted firmware, or failed field update?
- Which Bluetooth, EMC, radio, and battery-compliance activities apply?

**Gate 5 exit criterion:** the risk register contains evidence, owners, mitigations, and an explicit proceed, defer, or stop decision. Security, licensing, and regulatory issues cannot remain ownerless “later” work.

## Handoff to Product Design

The handoff package should include pinned source/SDK/dependencies, roles and state machine, capacity and recovery matrix, audio/RF/power measurements, antenna and acoustic assumptions, battery/charging boundaries, security/privacy model, licensing material, production-test needs, and recovery plan. Use the [SF32LB52x integration path](../sf32-products/chips/SF32LB52x.md#integration-path) to select the chip, module, board, hardware design guide, and checklist. Map qualified behavior into the custom schematic and layout instead of carrying development-board conclusions forward unchanged.
