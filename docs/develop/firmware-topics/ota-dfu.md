# OTA and DFU

DFU v2 is the SiFli-SDK firmware-update middleware for DFU and OTA workflows. It provides three transport channels: USB-CDC, BLE, and Bluetooth PAN. Each channel includes a user application and a matching loader subproject.

Start by selecting the transport that matches the product's update path. Then begin with the corresponding application example; its loader is brought into the build automatically.

## DFU v2 Structure

<div align="center"><em>Figure: DFU v2 example structure</em></div>

```text
dfu_v2/
├── cdc/       USB-CDC channel
│   ├── app/       User application and PC update tool
│   └── loader/    CDC DFU loader
├── ble/       BLE channel
│   ├── app/       BLE peripheral application
│   └── loader/    BLE DFU loader
└── bt_pan/    Bluetooth PAN channel
    ├── app/       Application that downloads firmware from a server
    └── loader/    PAN DFU loader
```

The application and loader for a given channel are designed to be used together. When you build an application, the SDK uses the `AddDFU_*` logic in `building.py` to include the matching loader as a subproject; do not build that loader separately. For BLE, the application supports runtime updates, while an update to the HCPU itself completes through the loader.

## Choose an Update Channel

| Channel | Documented update path | Typical fit |
| --- | --- | --- |
| USB-CDC | A PC updates the device through a USB virtual serial port. | Production, lab, and wired service workflows. |
| BLE | A BLE peripheral application receives an update. | A mobile app updates a connected product. |
| Bluetooth PAN | The device uses Bluetooth PAN networking to download an update from an HTTP server. | Connected products that retrieve their own update image. |

## Product Update Review

- [ ] The selected transport matches the product's available connection path.
- [ ] The application and matching loader are built and tested as one update flow.
- [ ] The supported target board is confirmed in that example's README.
- [ ] Update interruption, recovery, and factory-service behavior are defined for the product.
- [ ] Image authenticity, integrity, version policy, and partition capacity are reviewed for the product release.
- [ ] Failed-update logs can be collected without depending on a healthy application.

## Build a DFU v2 Example

From an example's `project/` directory, build with:

```bash
scons --board=<board-name> -j8
```

Each example README lists its supported boards. The DFU v2 middleware configuration itself is under `middleware/dfu_v2` in SiFli-SDK.
